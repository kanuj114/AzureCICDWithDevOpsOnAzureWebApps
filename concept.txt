-> Can you explain what is GitHub Actions.
Ans:
    GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) service built into GitHub.
    It allows you to automate software development workflows (build, test, deploy, release, etc.) directly 
    from your repository.

-> what is workflow of GitHub Actions(pipeline)... It has own worker process
-> Can you explain the GitHub Architecture.
-> Can you show the .yaml file where we applied CI/CD.
-> Application
   GitHub Actions(major features of GitHub)
   workflow(pipeline)
   CI/CD
   worker process(by default provided by GitHub Actions)
   Deployed on Azure WebApp/ Azure functions

Note : 2-3 sessions to cover key vault features

-> Pre-Requisite:
    Azure Service Bus Architecture

Note :

🔹 Key Concepts

1. Workflow – An automated process defined in a YAML file (.github/workflows/*.yml) in your repo.
2. Job – A set of steps executed on the same runner. A workflow may have multiple jobs.
3. Step – An individual task (e.g., run a command, use an action).
4. Action – A reusable piece of code (like plugins).
5. Runner – A server/machine where workflows run.

GitHub-hosted runner → managed by GitHub.

Introduction to xUnit

- CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, DevOps, Docker, Kubernetes
- Hands-on with SonarQube.

Case Study 1

- Library application needs to be referenced in xUnit application.
- xUnit application needs to be referenced in API application.

Case Study 2

Concept of Deployment Centre

- Authenticate and authorize between DevOps and Azure subscription.
- Deployment Group: On-agent IIS and Azure ACR as bridge.

- Multistage YAML → Either separate the build and release.
