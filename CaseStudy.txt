Azure DevOps does not provide the agent and hosting by itself.

Pipelines for CI/CD

A. .NET Core WebAPI + Azure SQL Server + CI/CD + Azure DevOps (Deployed on Azure WebApps).
   .NET Core running locally → Push to GitHub → Open Azure DevOps → (Service Connections: Authenticate the Azure Subscription) 
    → Then we can generate the pipeline for build and release on Azure Web App.
    
B. .NET Core WebAPI + Azure SQL Server + CI/CD + Azure DevOps (Deployed on IIS).
